"""
ACCELEROMETER INPUT DEMO: while the LED Glasses Driver has a perfectly
good clicky button for input, this code shows how one might instead use
the onboard accelerometer for interactions*.

Worn normally, the LED rings are simply lit a solid color.
TAP the eyeglass frames to cycle among a list of available colors.
LOOK DOWN to light the LED rings bright white -- for navigating steps
or finding the right key. LOOK BACK UP to return to solid color.
This uses only the rings, not the matrix portion.

* Like, if you have big ol' monster hands, that little button can be
  hard to click, y'know?
