CircuitPython Touch-Compatible Pin Identification Script

Depending on the order of the pins in the CircuitPython pin definition, some inaccessible pins
may be returned in the script results. Consult the board schematic and use your best judgement.

In some cases, such as LED, the associated pin, such as D13, may be accessible. The LED pin
name is first in the list in the pin definition, and is therefore printed in the results. The
pin name "LED" will work in code, but "D13" may be more obvious. Use the schematic to verify.
