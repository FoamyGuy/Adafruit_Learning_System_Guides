CircuitPython Canary Day and Night Light with Optional Network-Down Detection

This project uses the QT Py ESP32-S3 with the NeoPixel 5x5 LED Grid BFF, along with
a 3D printed bird. The LEDs light up different colors based on the time.

In the event that the internet connection fails, it will begin blinking red to notify you.
If the initial test ping fails, and the subsequent pings fail over 30 times, the board
will reset. Otherwise, the blinking will continue until the connection is back up. This
feature is enabled by default. It can easily be disabled at the beginning of the code.

# Network-down detection enable or disable.

# network is down, are both enabled. If you wish to disable this feature,

# conducive to waking up. The sleep color defaults to red to promote sleep. The wake
# color defaults to blue to promote wakefulness.

WAKE_COLOR = (0, 0, 255)  # Blue

# Sleep time.
# This is the hour in 24-hour time at which the light should change to the
# desired color for the time you intend to sleep.
# Must be an integer between 0 and 23. Defaults to 20 (8pm).

WAKE_TIME = 6

# Canary brightness customisation.
# Brightness must be a float or integer between 0.0 and 1.0, where 0.0 is off, and 1.0 is max.

# hit the rate limit, and the time check does not get throttled.

# Ping interval while ping is successful.
# This is the interval at which the code will send a ping while the network is up and the pings
# are successful. If for any reason you would prefer to slow down the ping interval, this value
# can be updated. Defaults to 1 second. Must be an integer equal to or greater than 1. Increase
# this value to increase the ping interval time. Do not decrease this value!

# This value is the number of times ping will consecutively fail before the canary begins blinking.
# If the blinking is happening too often, or if the network is often flaky, this value can be
# increased to extend the number of failures it takes to begin blinking.
# Defaults to 10. Must be an integer greater than 1.

# The amount of time in seconds that needs to pass while the network is down AND
# NETWORK_DOWN_DETECTION is DISABLED before the board resets to try again.

# this value to alter how long the network should be down in this specific case
# before the board resets.

# IP address.
