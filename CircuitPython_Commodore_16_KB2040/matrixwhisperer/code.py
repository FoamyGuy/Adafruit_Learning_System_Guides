# KeyMatrix Whisperer
#
# Interactively determine a matrix keypad's row and column pins
#
# Wait until the program prints "press keys now". Then, press and hold a key
# until it registers. Repeat until all rows and columns are identified. If your
# keyboard matrix does NOT have dioes, you MUST take care to only press a
# single key at a time.
#
# How identification is performed: When a key is pressed _some_ pair of I/Os
# will be connected. This code repeatedly scans all possible pairs, recording
# them.  The very first pass when no key is pressed is recorded as "junk" so it
# can be ignored.
#
# Then, the first I/O involved in the first non-junk press is arbitrarily
# recorded as a "row pin". If the matrix does not have diodes, this can
# actually vary from run to run or depending on the first key you pressed. The
# only net effect of this is that the row & column lists are exchanged.
#
# After enough key presses, you'll get a full list of "row" and "column" pins.
# For instance, on the Commodore 16 keyboard you'd get 8 row pins and 8 column pins.
#
# This doesn't help determine the LOGICAL ORDER of rows and columns or the
# physical layout of the keyboard. You still have to do that for yourself.
