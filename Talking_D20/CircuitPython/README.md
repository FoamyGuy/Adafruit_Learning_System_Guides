Talking_D20
===========

GREETINGS, ADVENTURER! This is the CircuitPython code for the revised Talking d20 project.

An earlier version of this project was written in Arduino and relied on different hardware. The code, hardware and 3D models are NOT interchangeable; each is specific to the corresponding version of the project.
