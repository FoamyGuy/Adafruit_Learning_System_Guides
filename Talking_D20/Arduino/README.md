Please visit the above guide for links to 3D-printable files, a list of parts and required Arduino libraries, and assembly instructions.

This project was later revisited using CircuitPython and the Adafruit Prop Maker Feather. This is located up one level in the CircuitPython folder. The code, hardware and 3D models are NOT interchangeable; each is specific to the corresponding version of the project.
