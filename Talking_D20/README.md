Talking_D20
===========

GREETINGS, ADVENTURER! This folder contains code and audio for TWO VERSIONS of the Talking D20 project.

The ORIGINAL project was written in Arduino and relied on separate accelerometer and audio decoder boards. This is in the 'Arduino' folder.

The REVISED project is written in CircuitPython and uses the all-in-one Adafruit Prop Maker Feather. This is in the 'CircuitPython' folder.

THE CODE, HARDWARE AND 3D MODELS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE; each is specific to the corresponding version of the project. The CircuitPython code will NOT work on the original design, nor will the Arduino code work on the newer design.
